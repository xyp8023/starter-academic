Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) comprise a network of sensors and actuators that are integrated with a computing and communication core. Hydrobatic Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) can be efficient and agile, offering new use cases in ocean production, environmental sensing and security. In this paper, a CPS concept for hydrobatic AUVs is validated in real- world field trials with the hydrobatic AUV SAM developed at the Swedish Maritime Robotics Center (SMaRC). We present system integration of hardware systems, software subsystems for mission planning using Neptus, mission execution using behavior trees, flight and trim control, navigation and dead reckoning. Together with the software systems, we show simulation environments in Simulink and Stonefish for virtual validation of the entire CPS. Extensive field validation of the different components of the CPS has been performed. Results of a field demonstration scenario involving the search and inspection of a submerged Mini Cooper using payload cameras on SAM in the Baltic Sea are presented. The full system including the mission planning interface, behavior tree, controllers, dead-reckoning and object detection algorithm is validated. The submerged target is successfully detected both in simulation and reality, and simulation tools show tight integration with target hardware.
