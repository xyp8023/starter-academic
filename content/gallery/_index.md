This is a photo gallery demo project for Netlify Large Media made with photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

This project has two branches:

- **master:** A photo gallery that does _not_ have Netlify Large Media enabled yet. You can follow the [README instructions](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-photo-gallery/blob/master/README.md/#how-to-deploy-your-own-photo-gallery-with-large-media) to deploy this with your Netlify account and start using Large Media yourself.
- **large-media-sample:** A copy of the photo gallery, with Netlify Large Media enabled. You can go to the files in the [static/images](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-photo-gallery/tree/large-media-sample/static/images) folder to see how large media assets are managed with Git. This branch is used to deploy the demo site, [https://netlify-photo-gallery.netlify.com/](https://netlify-photo-gallery.netlify.com/).

### What can I do with this?

If you want to try deploying your own photo gallery with Netlify Large Media, please go to the [README](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-photo-gallery/blob/master/README.md) for how to do it.
